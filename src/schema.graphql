# The typeDefs constant defines your GraphQL schema (more about this in a bit). 
# Here, it defines a simple Query type with one field called info. This field has 
# the type String!. The exclamation mark in the type definition means that this 
# field can never be null.

  feed: [Link]!

  # Remember the process of schema-driven development? It all starts with extending your 
  # schema definition with the new operations that you want to add to the API - in this 
  # case a signup and login mutation.
